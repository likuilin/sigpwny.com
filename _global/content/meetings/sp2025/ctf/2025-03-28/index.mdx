## Summary
Join us for a double CTF! We will be playing both DiceCTF 2025 and TAMUctf 2025 simultaneously! We plan to meet in-person at Siebel CS for this competition (room to be announced in Discord). Free pizza for dinner will be provided!

DiceCTF starts on Friday, March 28th at 4 PM CT while TAMUctf will start at 5 PM CT. Each competition runs for 48 hours from their start time.

Due to bracket restrictions, only undergraduates can participate in DiceCTF. Graduate students will play TAMUctf instead!
