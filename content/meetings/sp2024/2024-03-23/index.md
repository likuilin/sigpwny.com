TracerFire has students investigate multiple advanced persistent threat (APT) adversaries in a
simulated incident response scenario. Cyber forensic techniques/tools developed by Sandia are used
to discover:

• Who’s the adversary?
• How’d they get in?
• What did they want; did they succeed?
• How to prevent recurring incidents?\
