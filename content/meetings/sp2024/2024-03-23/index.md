TracerFire has students investigate multiple advanced persistent threat (APT) adversaries in a
simulated incident response scenario. Cyber forensic techniques/tools developed by Sandia are used to discover:

+ Who’s the adversary?
+ How’d they get in?
+ What did they want; did they succeed?
+ How to prevent recurring incidents?

The event will be in person on Saturday, March 23 from 9am-5pm and Sunday, March 24 from 9am-3pm. There will be a Sandia National Laboratory overview and Q&A on Friday March 22 from 6:30-8pm.
