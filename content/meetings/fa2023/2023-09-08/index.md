SIGPwny will be playing as a team in PatriotCTF 2023! We will be meeting in-person to solve challenges and also communicate over Discord. Make sure you check Discord for location and opt-in to our CTF channels with the `/ctf optin` command from pwnybot (you may need to configure Discord to show the `#bot-commands` channel to run this).

There will be free pizza! More information about the specific event is [here](https://competitivecyber.club/patriotctf/).
